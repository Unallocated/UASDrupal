-------------------------------------------------
- Added support for Silverlight
- Changes wording from "multi file" to "advanced" to prepare for future
  changes to allow use of Plupload for single file fields
- Fixed typo

-------------------------------------------------
- Set 1mb as fixed chunk size since this was changed to php post size as
  default in Plupload. We need 1mb chunks to make the Flash uploader more
  reliable and to provide upload progress.

filefield_sources_plupload 7.x-1.x, , 2012-02-13
-------------------------------------------------
- Changed code to not verify if max size is set within PHP limit, as Plupload
  use 1mb chunks (per default) and thus can transfer larger files without
  regard to PHP file or post max size-limitations.
- Added support for file size client side validation. Uses the field instance
  settings, and PHP max if not set. Does not use Plupload settings, but
  overrides these to behave the same way as the File field it is attached to.
